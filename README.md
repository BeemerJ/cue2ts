## Here's how the script works:

<details>
<summary><strong>parse_cue_sheet(cue_file):</strong></summary>
<br>
  <ul>This function takes the path to a cue sheet file as input.</ul>
  <ul>It reads the contents of the cue sheet file line by line.</ul>
  <ul>While iterating through the lines, it extracts information such as timestamps, song titles, and performers and stores them in separate lists.</ul>
  <ul>It returns three lists: timestamps, songs, and performers.</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>convert_to_youtube_timestamp(timestamps, songs, performers, output_file):</strong></summary>
<br>
    <ul>This function takes the lists of timestamps, songs, and performers generated by <strong>"parse_cue_sheet"</strong>, along with an output file path.</ul>
    <ul>It writes the information in a format suitable for YouTube timestamps to the specified output file.</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Main part of the script:</summary>
<br>
    <ul>It prompts the user to input the path to the cue file and the desired output file.</ul>
    <ul>It calls parse_cue_sheet to extract information from the cue file.</ul>
    <ul>It then calls <strong>convert_to_youtube_timestamp</strong> to write the extracted information to the output file in a YouTube timestamp-friendly format.</ul>
    <ul>Finally, it prints "Conversion complete!" to indicate that the conversion process is finished.</ul>
</details>
